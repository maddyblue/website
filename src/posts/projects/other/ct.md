[ct](https://github.com/maddyblue/ct) is a single page app that shows you the cocktails you can make based on the ingredients you have.
It also shows what you could make if you had more ingredients.
Mostly I use this now as a way to remember cocktails I liked and want to make myself.

(Hosting needs to be fixed.)
