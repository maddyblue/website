This is a [paper](/public/schalmei.pdf) I wrote in undergrad about a method to synthesize pipe organs.
Abstract:

> Synthetic sound generation techniques for pipe organs are currently based on samples and wave tables, and physical synthesis.
> The samples require expensive and time-consuming editing and recording.
> In this paper I present a method of synthesizing pipe organ sounds using additive synthesis by interpolating certain harmonics of recordings.
> The N largest frequency components of the power spectral density of each recording are found and analyzed to find their percentage power contribution to the overall recording and harmonic above the fundamental.
> Simple polynomial fit algorithms are applied to each of the N components and a function generated to describe them at any frequency.
> Unique sinusoids can be generated in real time at arbitrary frequencies and amplitudes without the need for samples or wave tables.
