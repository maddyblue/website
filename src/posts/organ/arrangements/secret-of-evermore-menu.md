I've always had a deep love for this game and its music. It was [Jeremy Soule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Soule)'s first game (he went on to do Skyrim and other Elder Scrolls, some World of Warcraft, Guild Wars). I'm drawn to this track and the whole soundtrack because of how it captures the environmental sounds and ambiance so well.
