This one has some interesting registration. The high drone part gets a second voice halfway through an octave lower than the start. Then later the high pitch goes up by a fifth. All of that can be reproduced using stops! Start with the 4 foot (in organ registration, 8 foot stops sound at the pitch they are written, 4 foot stops an octave up). Then add an 8 for the second voice down an octave. Last remove the 4 and add a 2 2/3 (sometimes called a twelfth or quint) which achieves moving the top voice up a fifth.
