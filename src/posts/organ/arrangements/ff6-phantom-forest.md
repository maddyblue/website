A difficult part of arranging for organ is the registration: choosing which organ stops to use for which voices/parts. Most of my other arrangements use relatively sparse registration (relative to what organs can do). This one I registered with a bit more. The pedal here carries the melody, hence being registered up two octaves. That allowed the manuals to have more complex parts!
