Organs are great instruments because of how many distinct voices get to exist with their own sound. This piece is fairly simple, but has enough different voices to make it interesting and lightly haunting. There's the intro [ostinato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato), the long pedal tones, and the high melody. Sadly the [pizzicato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzicato) that fades in and out would require a third arm, so it's omitted (this is the case in most SNES arrangements, so it goes).
