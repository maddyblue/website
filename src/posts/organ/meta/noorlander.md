I have a [Noorlander Praeludium](https://www.noorlanderorgels.com/en/organ-models/praeludium/) that sits in my living room. It runs [Hauptwerk](https://www.hauptwerk.com/): a program that takes midi input and plays back recordings from actual organs. The recordings are made one pipe at a time, then Hauptwerk mixes together whichever keys and stops are enabled. The folks who make the recordings love all the little nuances of organs and thus include things like:

- the ambient sound of the room with the blowers on
- the physical sound of the keys as they move
- the ca-thunk when stops are pulled or cancelled

I use the organs
